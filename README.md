# Corner Store
## About Us
CornerStore seeks to connect consumers through a network of Black Owned small businesses and vendors by creating an interactive website with specialized filters that allow for equitable results and the ability to see business information such as location, history, etc. Our solution would also allow for in-depth reviews.

Our goal is better to understand how we can best improve the user experience of finding Black-Owned Businesses in their area, that both fulfills them being socially conscious and supportive of a cause while having access to quality products and services.

## Jira Backlog
### Ordering of Backlog
* We are ordering the backlog based on what information we have and which are accomplishable without the assistance of another component to test the functionality (ie. having the database set up before developing a filter).
