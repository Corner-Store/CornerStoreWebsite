# Corner Store

## About Us

CornerStore seeks to connect consumers through a network of Black Owned small businesses and vendors by creating an interactive website with specialized filters that allow for equitable results and the ability to see business information such as location, history, etc. Our solution would also allow for in-depth reviews.

Our goal is better to understand how we can best improve the user experience of finding Black-Owned Businesses in their area, that both fulfills them being socially conscious and supportive of a cause while having access to quality products and services.

## Meet the Team

Junia Janvier: Team Lead
<br/> Joanna Jung: UI/UX Designer
<br/> Sophie Fang: Technical Member
<br/> Ha (Amelia) Nguyen: Technical Member
<br/> Abdul Ka: Technical Member

## How to Run Application

Frontend: yarn start
Backend: cd api; venv/bin/flask run --no-debugger

## Jira Backlog

### Ordering of Backlog

- We are ordering the backlog based on what information we have and which are accomplishable without the assistance of another component to test the functionality (ie. having the database set up before developing a filter).

## Sprint Planning

The forecast for our first sprint is to complete 2 with the first including plotting the intitial businesses and vendors and the second involving our design of the intitial page of the site. Due to the search and filtering to be closely tied, we decided to hold off on this to ensure that we can focus on developing our database as a team collective in the following sprint.

## Daily Scrums

### Daily Scrum #1

**During this scrum, we worked on developing our backlog, solution validations, and github/readme.**

- Backlog
  - Adding User stories to Jira Backlog (Amelia)
- Solution Validation
  - Interviews (All Team Members - Junia, Joanna, Sophie, Amelia and Abdul)
  - Website for validation exercise (Joanna)
- Github/Readme
  - Setting up Github/Readme (Sophie)
- UXD Snapshots
  - Working on next snapshot after Lo-Fi Wireframes (Joanna)

<br/>**Activities for Upcoming Week**

- Backlog (Ordered based on the user flow of consumers when navigating the app based on the feedback of interviews and validation)
  - Going into web app and seeing display of Black Owned Businesses and vendors (general info)
  - Seeing main page organized by categories with search engine (i.e. the UXD design)
- Solution Validation
  - Finishing up interviews (Joanna and Amelia)
  - Hypothesis List (Junia)
  - Putting final touches on the mock website (Joanna & Sophie)
- UXD Snapshots
  - Finish up snapshot - adjustments based on interview suggestions (Joanna)

<br/>**Impediments:**

- Tech Stack: Still in discussion, will be following up with mentors

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
